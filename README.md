# Managing Age-Based Scenarios
 In my JavaScript code, I declare a variable age using the var keyword and set it to the number 10.

I've implemented an if-else structure to handle different age scenarios:

If age is greater than or equal to 65, it logs: "You get your income from your pension."
In the "else if" block, I check if age is less than 65 and greater than or equal to 18. If true, it logs: "Each month you get a salary."
Another "else if" block checks if age is under 18. If true, it logs: "You get an allowance."
Finally, there's an "else" statement capturing any other value. It logs: "The value of the age variable is not numerical."
Feel free to adjust the age variable and run the program to observe different outputs based on the age conditions.
